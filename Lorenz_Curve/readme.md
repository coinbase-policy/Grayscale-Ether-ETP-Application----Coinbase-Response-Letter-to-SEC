The Lorenz Curve plots the minimum percentage of users needed to achieve a specific percetage of total BTC or ETH tokens on the Coinbase Platform. To learn more about Lorenz Curves, see [Gastwrich (1971)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1909675)

The raw data included the number of tokens owned by all coinbase users, and it cannot be disclosed for privacy reasons. Nonetheless, we disclose the code that produces these curves.

The [code](Lorenz_Curve.py) is in PySpark, a python-based API used for Spark and written in Scala programming language.
